# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This repository contains my solutions of the Udacity's [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188)

* [Introduction to PyTorch](https://github.com/jhairgallardo/Udacity_Intro_to_Pytorch/tree/master/Intro_to_pytorch): Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/jhairgallardo/Udacity_Intro_to_Pytorch/tree/master/convolutional-neural-networks): Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
* [Style Transfer](https://github.com/jhairgallardo/Udacity_Intro_to_Pytorch/tree/master/style-transfer): Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implement style transfer according to the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et. al. Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!
